# To begin:

# Take an input from the user for the total balance to be payed.
# Take an input from the user for minimum payment amount.
# Take an input from the user for how many payment periods they have until the deadline.
#################################
# Calculations:
# Calculate the monthly payment needed to fully pay off a balance with the allotted time frame. done
# Prompt the user to input the monthly payment amounts.done
# If the payment amount is too small, change to the minimum payment amount. done
# If the payment is larger than the remaining balance, change to the remaining balance.
